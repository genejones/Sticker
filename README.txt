PROJECT MOBILIZE

-Proof of concept TMS solution developed by yours truly over holiday break.
-Named for the process of troop deployment, sometimes called *mobilizing*; code deployment is the aim of a TMS
-Quick and dirty, built to show myself (and others) that a TMS can be built rather quickly, and to serve as the basis of a open-source TMS
-Tada!
